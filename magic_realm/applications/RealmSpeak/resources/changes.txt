# Added a "player password" concept for joining players.  If you use a password (it is optional), then your player name and password must match before you are given control of the character.  This would prevent someone else from grabbing your character while you were offline (especially possible in a "slow" game)!

# BUG 1432 - Fixed a problem where character horses were absorbing non-simultaneous hits.

# BUG 1222 - Fixed some problems with how abandoned color-source treasures were shown on the map, and in the "View Clearing Detail" window.
# BUG 1350 - Fixed a problem with casting Control Bats on a transformed bat.  Also made similar adjustments to other monster-specific spells, so that transformed dragons, goblins, spiders, etc can be targeted too.
# BUG 1367 - Fixed a bug with Magic Sight, that would cause a treasure card site (like Enchanted Meadow) to jump to the backwoods when a "Treasure cards" result was rolled!
# BUG 1347 - Fixed a bug that allowed monsters to attack a character playing a horse directly, if another character targeted the rider.
# BUG 1204 - Fixed a problem with random assignment, that was allowing two hidden characters with hirelings to take monsters not assigned to them, and end up in a game deadlock.
# BUG 1344 - Extending the game with low level characters, no longer leads to negative VP assignment!
# BUG 1134 - Unhired Native Leaders killed by PoP will drop inventory in the clearing correctly now.
# BUG 1227 - Fixed a deadlock related to Control Bats and Wish cast by two characters at the same time.
# BUG 1456 - When you start the game with a low level character, and seasons, you still must (at the least) record 2 VPs.
# BUG 1306 - Fixed a bug that was preventing hired leader's inventory from dropping into the clearing when killed by a monster.
# BUG 1384 - Persuaded Giants/Goblins will no longer block your hirelings

Version 0.60 - May 25, 2008 - Changes since 0.59.1 - SVN Revision 236
NEW FEATURES:
# Bunch of new features aimed at making Kyle's "Slow Game" concept workable:
	- When players are offline, RealmSpeak will no longer simply show "Not Online", but rather show the current step the player is doing.
	- Export HTML Game Summary feature
		> New File menu option allows anyone playing to generate a cluster of HTML documents that could be uploaded to the web, to describe the current state of the game.
		> You can generate these files ANYTIME, even during combat
	- Couple of game server improvements:
		> Added a 10-second timeout to the RealmSpeak server-side, so that random non-RealmSpeak connections don't tie up the connection pool.
		> Any connection which does not have a logical RealmSpeak-like request, will be immediately dropped.
	- Detail log is now persistent:
		> The log is saved anytime the game is saved (including autosave)
		> Players joining a server will get an automatic copy of the full log
		> You'll see a new "rslog" file along with your "rsgame" save files, with the same name
		> "rslog" files are NOT required to load a game, but if you load a game without a corresponding rslog file, your detail log will start out as empty
	- When joining a game, the last 10 IP addresses are remembered.
	- You can now view a readonly host pref dialog when you are not the host, so you can see which options the host is playing with.
	- Autosave used to only happen at the start of each new day, as any RealmSpeak veteran knows.  Now it will happen with more frequency, so that restarts are less painful:
		> At the start of each new day
		> At the beginning of every new turn
		> At the beginning of the every new clearing combat (NOT every round, though)
		> At the end of ALL combats (MIDNIGHT)
	- A separate autosave_birdsong.rsgame file is saved at the start of each new day, in case you want to replay the day (like RealmSpeak did previous to this release)
	- The e-mail framework is in place, but it DOES NOT DO EMAIL right now.  I still need to figure out where all to put stuff.
# RealmSpeak is now a bit more lenient with older version game files.  It WILL allow you to load them (with a warning), but you must keep in mind that there may be version-related bugs that come out of it.  In most cases however, this should work just fine.
# BUG 1324 - Using the remodeled counters, the hired leader chits now show their commerce behavior:  +N when they add notoriety, +F when they add fame, or both when they add both.
# BUG 235 - When the "Show Turn End Results" option is checked, the denizens that regenerated are shown at the start of your turn.
# BUG 979 - The Spell Selector dialog now shows the color(s) that will be available on the next 7th day, to help you decide which chits to start with as enchanted.
# A couple of combat sheet improvements:
	- BUG 995 - Mouseovers on castable spells on a character combat sheet will now show the spell full-size for clarity.
	- BUG 1003 - When transformed, your attack/move chits, and any head/club is shown next to your character counter, so you know what kind of damage you can deliver.
	- BUG 1015 - Round Summary button allows you a quick analysis of the current round, so you can see who hit who, and figure out what the die rolls were.  This feature is a little rough around the edges, but I think it accomplishes the task well enough.
		> Visually see whether you hit, undercut, or missed outright
		> Die rolls accompany each hit row where appropriate.  This will make Fiery Blast missile rolls a bit more obvious.
		> Character battle/maneuver chits are shown along with the token, so you can see WHY the hit happens.
		> Summary is shown in proper combat order, so you can follow the logic of the battle.
		> No more searching through the detail log to figure out why you lost a henchmen.
		> Does NOT show non-attack spells right now, so if you cast WISH on yourself, nothing will appear in the summary.
# BUG 628 - New House rule allows you to make the Lost City and Lost Castle act like shelters for purposes of sheltered phases and weather.  Obviously, if you are playing without weather, this will have no effect.
# BUG 948 - Following characters now get a button to allow them to stop following.  If you are being followed by other players, the Play All button will be disabled, and the Play Next button will force you to wait 5 seconds between clicks to allow other players to stop following.

# BUG 1014 - Fixed some problems with how Phase Chits were implemented.  Protection from Magic should work correctly now.
# BUG 1333 - Monster targets are cleared at the beginning of any new combat, to guarantee that no previous battles targets influence the current one (wish I knew how that happened anyway, but at least it wont be a problems anymore!)
# BUG 1080 - All combat participants are flipped to their light side before combat starts.  This actually happened already, but there were cases where this wasn't, and that is now fixed.
# BUG 1093 - Denizen's attacking a RED-side-up monster on a Character sheet will properly reposition and change tactics now.
# BUG 1025 - Dragon Essence is no longer affected by "Peace with Nature" (spell or ability), as per the rules.
# BUG 1034 - Fixed a loophole that would allow you to record an invalid move on purpose, while between clearings, to keep from having to move to either clearing.
# BUG 1335 - Fixed clearing 3 and 6 on the Lake tile, and Clearing 3 on the Tristar tile, to be WOODS (were mismarked as NORMAL).

# BUG 1047 - Fixed a couple of bugs related to killing a character with an absorbed monster:
	- You will now get an appropriate fame/notoriety bounty from the absorbed monster in addition to the notoriety of the killed character.
	- When a character is killed with their absorbed monster, the monster (which is killed too) will properly regenerate back to the setup card, the next time it is appropriate.
			
Version 0.59.1 - December 15, 2007 - Changes since 0.59 - SVN Revision 190
BUGS/ISSUES:
# BUG 1206 - Fixed a game killing bug that only occurs if you play with development rules turned OFF
# BUG 1207 - The "Distribute" button was not working if none of the players had inventory, but did have gold.  This is fixed.

Version 0.59 - December 14, 2007 - Changes since 0.58 - SVN Revision 189
NEW FEATURES:
# Character Builder
	- BUG 1190 - Edit Symbol (no longer "Load Symbol") now has an option for disabling the icon invert code for when the icon appears on solid black.  This is good for color icons.
	- BUG 1183 - New File menu option to export character graphics alone
	- BUG 1198 - Fixed a problem with monster immunity to "Flying Demon" - should have been "Winged Demon".  The Pilgrim will also behave now.
# Season/Weather Notifications
	- BUG 1180 - Whenever the season or weather changes, you'll see a green notification bar appear on the map.  It will vanish the first time you click on the map after its appearance.
	- BUG 1200 - Clicking on the map season icon will bring up a window that shows ALL the detail.  Hovering the mouse over the icon shows a quick summary of the weather details.
# BUG 1099 - A new button on the inventory panel called "Distribute" will appear in development games.  Allows you to share all your goods across all characters in the clearing for purposes of earning development stages.  Great for solo games.

# BUG 1179 - FLY chits can be fatigued now, when you are hit with Weather fatigue
# BUG 1189 - Flying companions can follow you when you FLY now.

# BUG 1202 - Curse and PoP, when cast by Imp/Demon, can be controlled with Magic Wand now, as well as any other die modifiers (ie., Lucky Charm)
		
Version 0.58 - December 2, 2007 - Changes since 0.57 - SVN Revision 182
NEW FEATURES:
# BUG 1180 - Added some popup info to the weather icon on the map (if you have it turned on, and weather is used), when the mouse hovers over it.  Tells you days, phases, and any special effect
# Character Builder Updates
	- BUG 1171 - Added spiders to the monster immunity page, and companion page
	- BUG 1170 - Choose between two classes (fighter and magicuser) for purposes of random selection in the chooser
	- BUG 1150 - When saving, a "Saved" window appears for a second to tell you that it worked
BUGS/ISSUES:

# FLY chit bugs fixed:
	- BUG 1151 - FLY chits available only when you achieve the correct level
	- BUG 1154 - FLY chits are fatigued properly when running away
	- BUG 1153 - FLY chits are properly included in the effort calculation now
	- BUG 1169 - Running away with the flying carpet is working properly again now.

Version 0.57 - November 21, 2007 - Changes since 0.56.1 - SVN Revision 178
NEW FEATURES:
# BUG 977 - When playing a local game (non-network), the gold chit placement dialog will allow you to place all the chits at once, and will not cycle through characters unnecessarily.
# New Custom Advantages
	- Lock picking (open VAULT, CRYPT, or CHEST without keys)
	- Different starting gold amount with an option for setting maximum recorded gold
	- Item Restrictions (i.e., can specify that Suit of Armor cannot be worn)
	- "Plus One" die mods (disadvantage)
	- Start the game with a companion
		> Many monster types (not all)
		> Transform types (Lion, Eagle, Bird, Squirrel, Frog)
		> If you are doing development, you DO get the companion when you achieve the level
		> Companions regenerate when you advance a level (is this too powerful?)
	- Rest counts double advantage (like Dwarf)
	- Walk Woods ability on the 7th day of the week
	- Monster Immunity - generalizes the concept of "Demon Immunity"
		> Demon Immunity is no longer available on the miscellaneous panel
		> You can specify any number of monsters, including those from Pruitt's expansion
		> Immunity means that the monster cannot attack you, cannot be lured, and cannot block you at any time.
	- Natural armor - character has a natural armor like monsters
		> Dampens attack sharpness as if it hit armor
		> If real armor is hit, it does NOT dampen sharpness again (unless you are playing with penetrating armor rules)
		> Once sharpness is dampened by this armor, the full effect of the attack is taken (i.e., you don't simply get a single wound!)
	- Not really an advantage, per se (it doesn't take up a slot), but you can create FLY chits among your regular character chits
		> FLY chits must have at least one effort asterisk to be valid.
		> FLY chits are fatigued when used, much like MAGIC chits - this is true for regular (daytime) movement, as well as combat maneuvering or running away.  Yeah, flying is hard.
		> You only fatigue a FLY chit when you "take off", not for every tile moved.
		> If you "take off", land, and "take off" again, you will be fatiguing TWO FLY chits, if you have them.
		> Because of the changes in the FLY code, if you have other options (flying steed, flying carpet, flying spell, etc) you don't need to fatigue your FLY chits.
	- Other special CHIT abilities:
		> BERSERK-like vulnerability adjustments
		> DUCK-like movement chits
		> DUCK-like fight chits
		> You get to give the chit its own "name" here, but MOVE, FIGHT, MAGIC, and FLY are reserved names.  Otherwise, anything goes:  take care not to make something toooo long.  :-)
# Character Builder
	- New chit INVALID indicator when chits are not... well... valid!
		> MOVE chits with a strength less than your vulnerability are invalid
		> MAGIC or FLY chits without effort asterisks are invalid
	- Added a new export function, so you can save an image of your character card without the picture
	- Added a "Suggest" button to the description field of every advantage type, so you can get a default if you don't feel like writing it yourself.
	- New "Edit Notes..." button allows you to add/edit notes for your character.  This is a good place to keep track of character versions, or mention that you made changes to someone else's design.
# Reworked flying logic
	- if you have multiple flying possibilities, you get to pick which one you want to use
	- if you will drop items by flying, you get a warning now BEFORE it happens
BUGS/ISSUES:
# Fixed a problem with giving weapons names with more than one word
# BUG 1119,1124 - Fixed problems with custom characters using "optional" advantages:
	- Druid Lull (no site chit summoning)
	- Magician's MAGIC chits don't fatigue
	- Wizard's ability to skip SPX phase
	- Druid's immunity to curses
# BUG 1120,1114,1117 - Fixed an issue with MEETING die roll modifications (affected both Knights, and custom characters with the meeting table diemods)
# BUG 1125 - Custom Characters with more than one extra phase, will behave properly now
# BUG 1116 - Added the awakened spell count to the search buttons for Read Runes

# BUG 1136 - A recurring problem with the three Map treasures is fixed.
# BUG 1122 - T chits without effort asterisks are no longer fatigued when opening the VAULT or CRYPT

NEW FEATURES:
# New Custom Advantages under Miscellaneous
	- Enhanced Peer ability
	- Remote Spell ability
	- Timeless Jewel-like ability
# More graphics file types supported:  GIF, PNG, JPG
# Character Card Exporter works (creates a JPG file)
	
Version 0.56 - November 9, 2007 - Changes since 0.55 - SVN Revision 161
NEW FEATURES:
# New Custom Character Support
	- Launch the character builder two ways:
		> LaunchCharacterBuilder.bat (provided)
		> Run RealmSpeak, and then look under the HELP menu
	- Design new characters from scratch, with full control over every aspect:
		> Names
		> Chits
		> Starting inventory (you can create your own weapons, or use the standard ones)
		> Relationships
		> Special Advantages (lots of options here)
		> Icons (token graphics, as well as individual badge icons and even weapons!)
		> Picture
	- Import one of the original 16 characters, and modify at will
	- Characters are saved as a single rschar file, which can be transferred easily from machine to machine
	- Simply drop the the character files into a "characters" folder (same level as "images" folder), and the characters are ready to go
	- Online play IS supported (Every player must have the same set of custom characters as the host, or they will not be able to join)
	- Fully formatted character cards can be generated as a gif at a click of a button, so these characters can be used in F2F or PBEM games too!
		> Uses the ACME Gif encoder:  http://www.acme.com/license.html
BUGS/ISSUES:
# BUG 1081 - Changed the wording on the "Exclude Starting Worth" description

NEW FEATURES:
# BUG 1013 - Added three layout options to the Window menu, including one that will automatically make your map as big as possible.  All three have keyboard shortcuts.
# Implemented new random number logic:
	- When you load a game, RealmSpeak will restore the random number generator to the state it was when you saved the game.
	- If you do the same actions during the day after a save, the same die rolls will occur
	- No more cheating when you fail that HIDE roll, and reload the game (though I can't stop you from changing your turn around, or adding more HIDE phases!)
	- Here's the best part:  when your game crashes right after something amazing happens (roll snake eyes at a treasure site with 1 item), you don't lose the roll, assuming you repeat the same actions!
BUGS/ISSUES:
# BUG 1056 - Fixed a bug that freezes the game when a previously controlled bat returns to the setup card
# BUG 1058,1060 - Fixed a bug in the TRADE action that freezes the game when you have an item in your inventory worth exactly zero for a particular native group.

# BUG 1050 - Moving out of Toadstool Circle after using SP phase no longer charges you phases retroactively

	- BUG 1078 - Newly gained chits are shown immediately in the chit panel now.
	- BUG 1055 - Gaining new chits while WITHERed will update the chits to fatigue appropriately now.

	- Added a new option to allow you to ignore your starting worth for purposes of advancement
	- Added a new option to allow you to gain your normal relationships at 3rd level (note:  this was the default in the previous version, but now you need to turn the option on to get it)
			
Version 0.54 - October 13, 2007 - Changes since 0.53 - SVN Revision 122
NEW FEATURES:
# BUG 604 - Character Development
	- You can select a character at less than level 4 ability
		> Fewer chits
		> Fewer spells
		> Fewer VPs
		> Possibily different starting inventory (or none at all!)
		> Different relationships
		> Fewer character advantages
	- Chits are gained with earned VPs
		> If VP assignment is turned off, then VPs earned in any category are credited, otherwise only those assigned categories count, and then only as much as you've assigned!
		> Look on victory point tab to see where you stand, as far as earned VPs, and how many you need to achieve the next chit or level.
		> Development progress bar on main character window gives you an indication of where you are, in terms of points, chits, and levels.
	- New levels bring new advantages (based on 3rd edition rules)
		> 1st advantage at 2nd level, 2nd advantage at 4th
		> Gaining optional advantages is varied (see 3rd ed rules)
		> Relationships are gained at 3rd edition:  these are additive, so that if you are using grudges/gratitudes, your existing relationships still modify the ones you are getting.
	- Advantages are represented by a "Badge", shown now above the color magic/curses panel
		> Hover mouse over badge to see text
		> Badges appear as you get them (if using development)
		> Witch's Familiar badge can be clicked on to enable/disable the familiar (this replaces the ugly Familiar button added in v0.52)
	- Extended Development (if you turn the option on) allows development past 4th, with appropriate bonuses:
		> Level 5 = 15 gold
		> Level 6 = Random treasure from any native group
		> Level 7 = 10 Notoriety and 5 Fame
		> Level 8 = Take one horse from any native group
		> Level 9 = Get one BONUS phase every day
		> Level 10 = Get one weapon/armor counter from any native group *OR* record a new spell

	- BUG 933 - Treasure backs on Setup Card show Large/Small, and Spell backs show type.
	- BUG 926 - New option in the options menu, to allow you to visualize clearing numbers on mouseover.  This can be very handy when a lot of clearings are covered by chits!
	- BUG 949 - Display game phase (BIRDSONG,DAYLIGHT,EVENING,MIDNIGHT) in the title bar of each character window.
	- BUG 949 - Added current season/weather to title bar on game map window

	- BUG 941 - All castable spells are visible on the spellcasters combat sheet during combat (but only for the owning player!)
	- BUG 935 - You can drop active inventory now (no need to deactivate first), unless of course the item cannot be deactivated (ie., potions)
	- BUG 934 - Fame/Notoriety value of inventory has been added to the detail view.
	- BUG 957 - You can view the price lists from the VIEW menu now.
	- BUG 879,931,937 - Character notebook tracks information you learn throughout the game:

		> Native & Visitor Treasures/Spells
		> Weather Chit
		> Custom notes can be added to your notebook by clicking a button
	- BUG 962 - The Witch has a new button that will enable her to turn her familiar ON or OFF.  This is useful in long games, where the familiar becomes fairly useless.
	- BUG 928 - Right-clicking on the treasure setup card will enable you to view the back sides of all the counters
	- Horses, Clubs, and Dragon Heads (if any) are now shown in the popup window on the treasure setup card.

		> Types of spells (if any) that your character can learn

# BUG 692 - By clicking the pony icon in the phase window, you can now lock the pony extra move, and use regular moves.  This will enable non-pony-mounted followers to stay with you as their guide.  Pony-locked moves are represented by "M!" instead of "M".
BUGS/ISSUES:
# BUG 917 - Monster die is red again
# BUG 925 - Casting a spell while hidden, no longer causes your hidden hirelings to be unhidden.
# BUG 913 - Fixed a problem where the Swordsman was not getting one die on rolls on the Commerce table.
# BUG 921 - Fixed the Warlock's special pricing to comply with 3rd edition rules, which really is a reflection of 2nd edition rules + The General's Errata.
# BUG 918 - Fixed the representation of ownership on Native Horses from extra boards.
# BUG 920 - Option to abandon Dragon Essence (and other enchanted treasures) before energizing permanent spells.
# BUG 902 - Boons taken by hiring are now treated the same as those taken by buying goods.

# BUG 915 - Fixed a bug that would crash a multi-player game, when more than one player is in a dwelling at the same time, and needs to buy drinks.  I think this same bug is responsible for other in-combat crashes, so I believe you will find it to be a lot more stable.
# BUG 908 - No longer able to make a controlled T Monster RED-side-up by simply flipping it in the Luring stage.
# BUG 869 - When all hirelings are held by Red-side-up monsters at once, and the character is absent/hidden, random assignment no longer locks up the game.

# BUG 964 - Map of Lost Ruins, and Map of Lost Castle no longer tied to specific board in a multi-board game (I could have sworn that was in the rules, but alas it is not!)
# BUG 966 - Frigid Air will no longer cause fatigue when you cancel an action.
# BUG 953 - Trade window shouldn't hide behind the main frame anymore.
# Fixed a problem in the battle builder, where characters were not getting the default starting native relationships.

Version 0.51 - September 5, 2007 - Changes since 0.50
NEW FEATURES:
# BUG 896 - Added the clearing color magic to the mouseover display
# BUG 883 - A new option in the option menu allows you to display monster numbers on the monster chits, where there is more than one kind of monster.  This is helpful (for example) when you need to identify which Bat is which.
BUGS/ISSUES:
# BUG 877 - Expansion tile Lake is properly distinguished from Ledges now.
# BUG 892 - Woodsgirl no longer gains ONE DIE advantage when in a clearing with her own cache.
# BUG 878 - Accidentally allowing characters to choose Visitor/Mission chits, and then changing your mind, will no longer leave the Choose button active.

	- BUG 898 - Game crashes when starting the Witch King with the ghosts
# BUG 887 - Denizens returning to the setup card will correctly have all bewitching spells canceled

# BUG 886 - Inert spells (ie., Transform) that are nullified by Melt-into-Mist, will no longer energize when Melt-into-Mist goes Inert.
# BUG 884 - The T Dragon from the Transform spell is now armored, as it should be.

Version 0.50 - July 13, 2007 - Changes since 0.49 - SVN Revision 214
NEW FEATURES:
# BUG 440 - Added a new option (Option Menu) to allow you to switch the look and feel to "Cross-Platform".  Hopefully, this will resolve the strange graphics problems on Solaris machines.
# Hidden Enemy status shown in character spy window (the one you get when you double-click a character in the character list window)
# Backspace button allows you to "unsend" your recorded turn, in case you change your mind before the other players have finished recording.
# Option to include a random mix of expansion tiles
	- Ambush always starts enchanted side up, to facilitate placement
	- Paths/Passages attached to tile edges work like one-way gates.  For example:
		> Tile A Clearing 1 connects to the north edge of the tile via normal road
		> Tile B Clearing 5 connects to the south edge of the tile via hidden path
		> You can move from A1 to B5 without knowing the path
		> You must discover the path to move from B5 back to A1
		> There are only two tiles where this matters:  Dark Forest and Pinnacle
	- Chasm logic is not implemented (normally prevents woodswalking across chasm)
	- Volcano logic IS implemented:
		> Red-clearings cause daily fatigue
		> Orange-clearings cause daily wounds
		> White-clearings cause daily serious wounds (1d6 wounds)
		> Hirelings are NOT affected by any of these (I agree that doesn't make sense), but for now, that's how it is
	- If you do a multi-board, you will not necessarily end up with two of every tile, but you will still have:
		> 5 "Mountain" tiles for every board
		> 5 "Caves" tiles for every board
		> 5 "Valley/Swamp" tiles for every board
		> 5 Woods tiles for every board
	- NONE of the rest of the expansion (spells, treasures) is implemented:  this is just an inclusion of the new tiles
	- If you don't like this ruleset, then don't play with this option turned on
BUGS/ISSUES:
# Fixed a problem where recording a turn, and then saving the game would create a situation that made loading the game impossible
# Clearing plot (the yellow line that shows which clearings you are planning on moving to) is updated when different characters are selected in the character list.  This is only applicable if you have multiple characters, and are plotting their turns simultaneously.
# BUG 867 - Changed the threading logic on a major piece of the program that I'm hoping will eliminate the possibility of a deadlock on Solaris 10 running Java 1.6.
# BUG 821 - Fixed a strange bug that would occasionally crash the game on a double-board.
# Fixed a graphics anomoly that was appearing on triple/quad boards
# Added an optimization to the map building code that has a noticable speed improvement in the auto-builds of multi-boards.
# BUG 729 - Shielded Lantern, when activated in a cave with the Timeless Jewel, will properly allow you to take a bonus phase.
	
Version 0.49 - July 9, 2007 - Changes since 0.48 - SVN Revision 211
NEW FEATURES:
# BUG 75,313 - Characters can block other characters now
	- Each character has a "BLOCK ON/OFF" button on their frame
	- When this button is active, all characters passing through your clearing must get approval before continuing with their turn
	- If you are the blocking character, a "Block Now!" button will appear that will allow you to determine whether or not to block.
	- Once approval has been given, the only way to reset, is to turn the button off, and then on again
	- Midnight resets all block buttons
	- You cannot block hidden characters, unless you have found hidden enemies that day
# BUG 313 - Characters can block monsters now
	- Activate the "BLOCK ON" button when moving through clearings with monsters

	- Pressing the button gives you an opportunity to block the monsters in your clearing
# New icons in character frame
	- Block icon shows if you've been blocked
	- Hidden Enemies icon shows if you've found hidden enemies - mouse over to see who, if you found enemies using magic sight
# Battle Builder has new option to specify whether the character has "Found Hidden Enemies" or not
# BUG 552 - New "Day End Trades" checkbox on every character frame, allows players to do trades/rearrangements once combat has ended (but before MIDNIGHT)
# BUG 618 - Missions are affected by season now (if you are playing seasons).
BUGS/ISSUES:
# BUG 854 - Using a color chit during the actions phase will no longer disable the run button.

# BUG 863 - The "End Game" menu item now reads "Exit Game" to distinguish it from the END game button, which does an entirely different thing.
# BUG 774 - Hired Leaders that find hidden enemies during the day can be deployed to hidden targets during combat now.
# Charging a hidden character now requires that you find hidden enemies.
# Switched the wording and logic on the "Decline Opportunity" dialog, so that it doesn't require a voting mentality to figure out which way to go.
# BUG 796 - Fixed a nasty bug that would crash combat anytime an unhired native HQ was killed, and grudges/gratitudes is in play.
# BUG 793 - Denizens transformed into mist become unassigned, and cannot be randomly assigned, lured, or deployed against.
# BUG 858 - Fixed the mission logic for multiple boards.
# Fixed a issue that was causing missions/campaign from BOTH boards to be summoned
# BUG 829 - Fixed cross-board specials
	- Lost Keys match to Vault and Chest from same board
	- Maps of Lost City/Castle match chits from same board
# Pressing END game does some additional work:

	- BUG 537 - All spells (of every type) are cancelled.
# BUG 624,818 - Treasure setup card improvements:
	- Visitors are all available in the sidebar
	- All cache's appear on the sidebar

# BUG 521 - Native horses no longer grant an extra move in the caves.
# BUG 866 - Positioning stage is enabled every round of combat (used to only show when there was somebody targeted).  This will enable the strategy of extending combat while hidden, by playing two asterisks during this stage.
# BUG 792 - Followers that get blocked, can still finish the follow activities.
# "Find Hidden Enemies and Paths" Peer result was NOT setting the hidden enemies flag (Only "Find Hidden Enemies" was).

# BUG 133 - Riding Horses Optional rule implemented
# BUG 134,135 - Horses in combat, Optional rules implemented
# BUG 136 - Penetrating Armor Optional rules implemented
# BUG 844 - New Calendar window (thanks Dave S for the great idea!)
	- Shows the current day from the perspective of an entire month
	- Shows all the 7th day colors
	- Season (if any) and weather (if any) are shown, and a detail button allows access to more information about the displayed month.
	- Some notes on specific days to identify when:
		> Weather changes
		> Denizens reset
	- If playing with seasons, you can step through the months to see what is coming
	- Since this button is on the character list window, you can check the season (when using random seasons) before picking a character

	- Treasure Setup Card View

	- BUG 852 - Transform and Weather dialogs

	- View Remodeled Counters

	- Spellcasters don't have to wait for other players to press next
	- Pressing END only confirms with the non-locked characters
	- Currently, there is no way to undo the lock for a given combat, so don't activate it unless you really want out
	- Use this as a convenience, not as a way out of trouble!  If there are hostile characters in the clearing, locking your next button is the surest way to die.
	- Cannot lock ALL characters.  The last character must either play the combat through, or press END.
# BUG 633 - New House rule must be turned on for results of looting and reading runes to appear in the log (which is visible to all players)

	- Missions from Board B affect only natives from Board B, and so on.
# BUG 644 - Characters that restart will get a fresh slate with the natives.
# BUG 416 - When you fly to a tile, and record a non-fly action, the character token is moved to the clearing immediately so you can decide what to do.
# BUG 462 - If you transform after recording phases gained by activated treasure items, those items will no longer be automatically activated, and the phases will be cancelled.
# BUG 689 - Activated items that become inactivated due to a transmorphing spell, will return to active state when the spell goes inert.

# Player Board Builder is fully working (see bugs below) - I know I've said this before, but it really is working now.  Give it a try!
# Changed "Double Board" feature into an expandable "Multi Board", allowing up to 4 boards to be in play at once (OMG!!)
	- I haven't playtested anything beyond a double board except to see the map, but it should work
	- The only real issues are memory and speed
		> I might need to bump the memory allocation in the batch file for boards larger than 2 (even 2 is pushing the limit!)
		> You will notice that the game startup is slower, but overall, things should run normally
	- Notice the different chit renderings for Board B, C, and D.
	- Quad boards might make for good multi-month games (someday, character development games)
	- I did get an OutOfMemory error trying out the 3 board game, so maybe its not quite ready for prime time...  If I can figure out a better way to handle the board memory...
# BUG 442 - Solitaire Play Options (see new "Expanding the Realm" tab)
	- Two rows of monsters prowling (instead of one)
	- Dwellings not revealed at the beginning:  discovered like campfires

	- Fixed the issues with building a map in an online game

# BUG 419 - New "Land Now" button in the turn interface will enable flying Timeless Jewel users to land before they perform further actions.
# Added the "Die Roll" to the popup season/weather dialog, so you can tell better what happened to change the weather, or interpret the weather chit.

# BUG 828 - Summoning logic with double boards is fixed.  Monsters/Natives will summon properly now.

	- Illusion
	- Bad Luck
	- Lost
	- Violent Storm
	- Hurricane Winds

# New "Suggest Action" feature in combat (VERY alpha right now)
# BUG 742 - Added a check for character attack placement, so that you wont forget to do this, and get yourself killed!
# BUG 479 - A new house rule to allow you to decline an OPPORTUNITY roll on MEETING/COMMERCE, and instead take the result of rolling a 2 on the same table.

# Added log button back to main character panel - I should have never removed it
BUGS/ISSUES:

# BUG 494,698 - Fixed a problem where deploying a native to an unassigned denizen, and then pressing cancel, was causing the denizen to vanish

NEW FEATURES:
# NEW SPELL:  Enchant Artifact works now! (caveat: you can still only use the artifact once per combat - I will fix this part eventually)
BUGS/ISSUES:
# Fixed a problem with "Whistle for Monsters" that was freezing the combat interface after the first round.
# Reworked the spell targeting logic (behind the scenes) to make it a bit more robust
# Fixed a problem with "Talk to Wise Bird", that resulted from changes made to the trade interface in v0.44
# Fixed a speed problem when playing online
	- This will virtually eliminate those long delays during combat when multiple things are happening at once
	- Everything will be as fast as your connection, instead of being tied to a speed defined in the code (at long last!!)

Version 0.44 - May 20, 2007 - Changes since 0.43 - SVN Revision 156
BUGS/ISSUES:
# BUG 785 - Can loot the treasure sites again.
# BUG 730,741 - TENTATIVE fix.  I think that I found the culprit, but I can't really prove it, because I've never been able to reliably reproduce it.

Version 0.43 - May 6, 2007 - Changes since 0.42 - SVN Revision 149
NEW FEATURES:
# BUG 749 - Fixed how game end works, and how/where you extend the game.
	- New button "End Game" allows to force the current game to end.
	- New button "Reveal All" allows you reveal all chits/cards at the natural end of a game.
	- "Extend Game 1 Month" button moved out of character panel, and onto main character list.
# BUG 629,725 - Changed how VPs are allocated.  Instead of getting them piecemeal, you must allocate all of them at the beginning of the game.
	- Considers the number of months to play, and seasons, if applicable
	- Extending the game 1 month at a time will still ask for more VPs.
# BUG 735 - "Items and Horses" table from page 17 of the 3rd-edition rules is now available in the view menu

# BUG 660 - Choosing a spell target now includes a small icon indicating the combat sheet they are on (if any)

Version 0.42 - March 16, 2007 - Changes since 0.41 - SVN Revision 78
NEW IMAGES actions0.gif and actions1.gif in images/combat/buttons - new resource pack...
NEW FEATURES:
# BUG 461 - Action menu supports using keyboard shortcuts to enter your characters turn.
# BUG 21 - At long last, the wish table result "I Wish You Were Elsewhere" is finished.  There is a caveat:  the casting player gets to choose where the target character goes (the rules say it is up to the character being teleported), but that can be worked out manually for now (ie., please send me to the crags, clearing 6, thank you).
# BUG 649 - Treasure Setup Card changes:
	- Allows "peeking" at the stacks to see:
		> Monsters
		> Weapons/Armor (ie., helmet, breastplate, shield, ponies, etc.)
		> Number of Treasures
		> Number and types of Spells
		> Treasures-Within-Treasures
		> Spells on treasures
	- When game ends, the peeks allow you to view the cards "face up", so you can see what you didn't get!
BUGS/ISSUES:
# Fixed a general issue that caused RealmSpeak to repeatedly forget join information (when logging in)
# BUG 704 - Native Leader carrying a horse no longer crashes the game.
# BUG 726 - Can't abandon or CACHE a BOON token

# BUG 500 - Fixed the behavior for a spellcaster that is "buffing up" in an empty clearing.
# BUG 708 - Wish for Vision no longer shows you the backs of cards.
# BUG 721 - VI, VII, and VIII chits can be alerted in the battle builder.
# BUG 707 - Fixed a bug that would sometimes report a path had vanished when trying to run, when it fact it was still there!
# BUG 728 - RealmSpeak will now inform you when one or more of your followers are encumbered, and give you a chance to resolve the problem BEFORE moving, and leaving them behind.
# BUG 730 - Trade/Share mods
	- Only works now if you are the active player.  Though this goes against the rules, somewhat, I'm hoping it will lessen the likelihood of a game crash in the short term.  In the long term, I'm hoping I can figure out a better way to handle the trade frame.
	- Available in the combat frame for "End of Combat" trading.
# BUG 717 - "Wish I Was Elsewhere" will not crash the game anymore.
# BUG 652 - Text on turn action rows wraps around, so you can see all of it without going to the log.  Also, the latest processed action is always scrolled into view.
# BUG 737 - Text on enchanted chits is easier to read.

Version 0.41 - January 6, 2007 - Changes since 0.40
NEW FEATURES:

# BUG 675 - Elusive Cloak works with non-character chits now
# BUG 435 - Flowers of Rest work now, even if you don't record any actions.  They also work in the situation where someone carrying the Flowers of Rest moves through, but does not stop in a clearing with a fatigued character. This will now appropriately put that character to sleep, whether or not they've had a turn.
# BUG 676 - Controlled monster head/club kills count towards character total
# BUG 671 - Alerted chits will appear in the fatigue/wound dialogs now
# BUG 680 - If you MOVE, enchant a tile, and then try to run from combat, the road must not vanish or become "undiscovered", or you will now be unable to run. (see 3rd ed 7.10.4.d.1)

Version 0.40 - January 1, 2007 - Changes since 0.39
NEW FEATURES:
# This version of RealmSpeak is compiled under Java 1.5, and may encounter problems with Java 1.4.  I recommend upgrading your Java installation to play it.  Sorry for the inconvenience, but it was a necessary move.
# You can include Giants/Ogres/Goblins as hirelings in the combat builder now
# Fixed a performance bug in the board builder:  boards are built nearly instantaneously now.  This really helps in the case of double-boards.
# Players can build the board now!
	- New option in game setup window allows you to choose between auto-build, and player-build.
	- Host waits until ALL players have logged in, and then presses the "Build Map" button.  Tiles are distributed, and players start placing tiles, starting with the player who has Borderland. (Borderland A in a double-board game)
	- When playing solitaire, this option provides single tiles that you can place one at a time, starting with Borderland.
	- When the very rare situation arises where a player can no longer place a tile, it should start the process over, though I've been having trouble with this part.  I will clean this up at a later date.
# BUG 389 - New feature on inventory, and unassigned denizen panels:  clicking on a green eye icon allows you to view the other side of counters contained within.
# BUG 506 - Natives with living horses have a horse icon on them now, so you can distinguish them from natives with dead horses during the luring step in combat.
# BUG 654 - New house rule allows you to play where monster weapon hits (head/club) aren't sufficient to cause T Monsters to turn RED side up
BUGS/ISSUES:
# BUG 650 - Fixed an error that happened during summoning on double boards.
# BUG 646 - Native terms of hire are by days, not turns now (ie., when playing shortened weeks in seasons)
# BUG 661 - HIRE phases when dealing with pacified monsters, will be hired as a "group", not individually
# BUG 662 - Hired Ogres and Goblins that own their combat sheet can be flipped like hired natives now

# BUG 664 - Fixed a double-board bug that caused the game to freeze when you ran away in a "B" tile.
# BUG 665 - Fixed a problem where using the Timeless Jewel, and trying to move down an undiscovered path, caused the game to hang.
# Cleaned up a problem with the client/server code that could cause some rare data loss during transfers.  This may have been the source of random hangs for some time, but I'm not sure.  Time will tell!
# BUG 687 - Fixed a typo in the length of T Dragon heads to 9 (not 8!)
# BUG 663 - Ambush works with non-attack spells that target individuals now.
# BUG 670,673 - Non-characters are no longer considered for the Hall of Fame.  Game date is included in the display.
# BUG 678 - Spells are no longer "doubled" in the spell chooser when playing a double-board game
# BUG 666 - Fixed the multiplying phantasms crash bug
# BUG 653 - T chits created by Unleash Power spell will suffice for opening the Vault.
# BUG 682 - Fixed a problem where Hired Leaders were not using their own horses to carry inventory.
# BUG 677 - Dragonfang Necklace and other control spells are cancelled if hirelings are attacking the target.
# BUG 525 - Fixed an issue that left luring hirelings unassigned if they lured a Giant or T Dragon, instead of moving to the new sheet.
# BUG 674 - Transmorphed monsters in color magic will no longer crash the game when they are summoned back to the setup card
# BUG 655 - Casters that are killed by non-simultaneous attacks, will have their attack spells cancelled.
# BUG 535 - Mission chits are completed automatically when you enter the target dwelling now, instead of waiting until midnight.
# BUG 487 - When you move by clicking on the map, you will get the "unassigned hirelings" warning now (if appropriate).

Version 0.39 - December 2, 2006 - Changes since 0.38a
NEW FEATURES:
# Rearranged the host game setup dialog a bit, to make your choices a bit more clear:
	- Got rid of meaningless fields (game title, game setup)
	- Separated "host" options from "game" options
	- Moved the weather option out of the Optional tab (too many people not seeing it there), and onto the main tab.
# Weather info dialog improvements
	- Includes 7th day color magic
	- Shows ALL weather possibilities, with the current weather highlighted
# BUG 346 - Support for Double Board (experimental)
	- New choice in setup dialog
	- Experimental means that I haven't tried everything yet, so you may encounter some "weirdness".
	- Double-board means more memory, slower startup, and slower initial network connections (if playing online).  You've been warned!
	- It is worth looking at - pretty danged cool.
	- Treasures are limited to their own setup cards, and chits to their own tiles, which is wrong I know.  It makes it playable, though not as variable as the rules allow.  I'll tackle this at a later date.
BUGS/ISSUES:
# BUG 627 - Choosing a Random Season no longer causes the season to change randomly each time you reload the game.
# BUG 459 - If you are starting RealmSpeak from the command line, you can include the savegame filepath after "run" to have it loaded automatically.  If you don't understand this, you probably don't need to use it.
# BUG 512,625 - Persuade/HIRE works with Giants and Ogres again
# BUG 611 - Characters put to sleep by the Flowers of Rest, will no longer summon monsters

# BUG 635 - Roof Collapses appears correctly on combat sheets, so you know it's been placed.
# BUG 642 - Chapel emits WHITE magic again.
# BUG 641 - Fatigue dialog allows fatiguing MAGIC chits for weather fatigue
# BUG 581 - When characters leave hirelings behind in a clearing with natives, the character no longer has an opportunity to buy drinks.
# BUG 577 - Flying characters will be blocked immediately after landing in a clearing with a monster.  No more free HIDE phase!
# Changed how the dotted (flying) lines are drawn when plotting a FLY move.  Rather than end at the "offroad" location, they go to the center of the tile.  Flying chits are still drawn in the offroad location, so that they aren't confused with those that are in clearings.
# BUG 584 - Natives with ponies moving out of caves don't gain pony moves during the turn.
# BUG 636 - Blazing Light works when you move out of the clearing now.
# BUG 643 - Ghosts regenerate each week again.

		> Fatigue chits based on location
		> HIDE/PEER tables disabled depending on season
	- Mission special conditions (delivery locations and rewards) are NOT YET HANDLED
BUGS/ISSUES:
# BUG 608 - Items with conditional fame are priced correctly now under COMMERCE rules
# BUG 488,609 - Using a Horse and "other" bonus MOVE in a cave is more logical now (horse is used as soon as possible)
# BUG 597 - Fixed game hang when a transformed monster winds up in an enchanted tile, and stuck in magic form.
# BUG 519,613 - Fixed a problem where a character receiving and activating the Timeless Jewel on someone else's turn, couldn't ignore their recorded actions.
# BUG 600 - Transformed monsters should prowl as normal now.
# BUG 614 - When I fixed Bug 305 (below), I inadvertantly introduced a problem when running without any monsters in the clearing.  This is fixed.

# BUG 218 - Color chits are now considered to be "in play" for purposes of determining death.

# BUG 544 - Cloven Hoof no longer affects denizen rolls anymore.
# BUG 533 - Kill tally no longer shows multiple hits for split kills
# BUG 548 - Effects of the poison spell and Oil of Poison will stack.  In other words, you can add 2 sharpness stars to your active weapon.
# BUG 573 - Can no longer use Pony to infinitely traverse mountains.
# BUG 424 - REST stacking with the Berserker works correctly now
# BUG 490 - Unhidden hired leaders in a clearing with a monster can no longer press the END button to exit combat.
# BUG 475 - Burning a color chit is sufficient to continue combat.
# BUG 518 - Correct number of soldiers on Pillage campaign.
# BUG 542 - Vial of Healing will now activate wounded, non-asterisk chits.

# BUG 621 - Fixed a small problem with CACHEs.
# BUG 575 - Can no longer use MAGIC SIGHT to learn spells off inactive inventory

# BUG 622 - Timeless Jewel owners can do multiple REST phases at once now.  Pressing REST will pop up a dialog asking "How Many".  Hope this isn't more of a pain than before!

# Most die roll tables are now available in the "Tables" menu
# RealmSpeak Battle Builder got a face lift
	- Entry dialog is a bit more user-friendly
	- Three choices:  New Battle, Edit Battle, and Play Battle
	- Yes, you can edit battles you have saved (finally!!!), including game options!
	- The builder is a Frame instead of a dialog now.  That means it will appear in your Taskbar, and not get "lost" in the sea of windows.
	- You can delete a character from battle
	- Treasures are sorted in alphabetical order, to make them easier to find (finally!!!)
# BUG 231 - New button to allow the HOST to change game options during the game.  (Like, if Watchful Natives breaks again, and you got a good game going, you can turn it off)
BUGS/ISSUES:
# BUG 606 - Flying causes you to become unhidden now
# BUG 601 - Sharpness dampening is shown in log now

# Optional Grudges/Gratitude
	- Buying/Selling treasures with special FAME affect friendliness
	- Killing FRIENDLY and ALLY natives affect friendliness by 2 and 4 levels, respectively.
# Changed the spell selector a bit:  removed the blue arrow buttons - selecting spells is now as easy as clicking the spell you want.  I thought having to select spells and press buttons was a bit tedious.
# Power of the Pit dialog now shows who all was killed (if any), so it is clear what happened.
BUGS/ISSUES:
# BUG 410 - Running as a transformed monster no longer adds the same monster to the "Used Chits" box, and available for attacks by yourself!!
# BUG 579 - Added some code to guarantee that NO situation leads to a target not moving to their own sheet.  This should resolve "Watchful Natives" once and for all.

Version 0.35 - October 25, 2006 - Changes since 0.34
NEW FEATURES:
# New Spells working:
	- Talk to Wise Bird
	- World Fades
	- Broomstick - works for flying self only (cannot affect other characters yet, though you can cast it on them)
# Added target information to spell cards
# Added Character name to combat sheets
# Revamped the character chit display to group like chits together - makes it a bit easier to see what you want.  This affects:
	- Initial chit enchantment when choosing a new magic user (MUCH easier on the eyes)
	- Fatigue/Rest/Wound displays
	- Combat builder display allows easy clicking to change the state (no more buttons to do this)
	- Character chit display now has a "detail" button to bring up the new grouped display
BUGS/ISSUES:

# Fixed an infinite loop that occurs when the Witch's familiar is following her when she discovers or loots a treasure Site.
# Game no longer hangs when a hired leader hires another native
# Fixed a problem where simultaneous attacks hitting a treasure card were spilling through to other armor.
# Must land after running with a fly action.  You can fly again, if you have the magic.
# Fixed the logic of Site Cards:  They are added to the bottom of the treasure pile so they can be found by other characters.  They remain visible on the board, however.
# Fixed the run-away logic for flyers:  only flying opponents can stop you from running if you are flying away
# Timeless Jewel now properly handles newly activated items and horses

Version 0.34 - September 22, 2006 - Changes since 0.33
BUGS/ISSUES:
# Magic users casting area affect spells (ie., Fiery Blast) will properly become unhidden
# Players using "Watchful Natives" will no longer have trouble with monsters not moving to their own sheet on attacking from hidden.

Version 0.33 - September 9, 2006 - Changes since 0.32
NEW FEATURES:
# A new Window menu item allows you to view the game options that are in play.  This is especially helpful if you've joined an online game, and you want to know which optional/advanced rules are being used.
# Character chooser now has two new "random" buttons for selecting a fighter or a magic user.  Regardless of whether you agree with me or not, this is how I characterized them:
	- Fighters: Woods Girl, White Knight, Berserker, Dwarf, Black Knight, Amazon, Swordsman, Captain
	- Magic Users: Witch, Witch King, Druid, Elf, Sorceror, Magician, Wizard, Pilgrim
BUGS/ISSUES:
# Fixed a bug introduced in 0.32 that breaks the game when you aquire the Dragon Essence
# Fixed a bug introduced in 0.31 that was not properly "unhiding" characters when they attacked in combat
# The buttons that "fatigue color chit" now read "play color chit" for clarity
# Permanent spells are energized appropriately when a game is loaded.
# Rare problem with extending a game is fixed.
# Fixed some more Timeless Jewel issues:
	- Cancelling an action (ie., SEARCH, ALERT, MOVE) will no longer "cost" you an action phase.
	- Deactivating the Timeless Jewel now presents you with an "Are you sure?" dialog, so you can change your mind.
# Fixed the spell order on Sites and Books so that higher numbered spell types come before lower ones
# Characters with timeless jewel active can still FOLLOW other characters, provided they record a FOLLOW during BIRDSONG
# Fixed a nasty bug with Food/Ale, and Escort Party, that was causing the game to crash.  There was also a rare bug that I discovered in the same code that would cause other gold chits to crash the game on occasion.
# Set the maximum allowable characters to "8", because there are too many problems with memory past that point.  Yes, I know that's a kludgy way to solve the problem, but until I can find the source, I'm stuck with this solution for now.
# Using a color chit during combat is sufficient to keep the combat going (was being ignored)
# Fixed Victory Point calculations for Fame and Gold when cursed with Disgust or Ashes.
# Abandoned hidden hired natives become unhidden next turn as they should.
# Belongings can now only be rearranged at the beginning of a phase, unless the item has just been aquired.
# Fixed a bug that was crashing the game when someone followed a leader that did both ALERT and REST during their turn
# Fixed a situation where it was possible to end up with an active Pony carrying an object that was too heavy
# Trading can now only occur at the beginning of a phase, or with someone who is playing their turn (3e-7.2.1)
# Fixed the sort order of items in a clearing, so that Monsters no longer appear underneath treasures.
# Natives can no longer ride dead horses during the day.
# Dwarven REST bonus, and Poultice of Health no longer cost actual REST phases
# Following the Dwarf, or someone who has just used the Poultice of Health, no longer gives you the double-asterisk bonus.

Version 0.32 - August 6, 2006 - Changes since 0.31
NEW FEATURES:
# You can repay a boon now
	- Receiving a boon puts a "Boon" token in your active inventory, showing the native/visitor, and the base price of the item given
	- The Boon token cannot be dropped or traded
	- To repay a boon, return to the native group, and do a BUY trade.  The boon will appear in their inventory, and you can buy it there.  Of course, you only have one chance to succeed, so don't attempt it unless you got the cash!
BUGS/ISSUES:
# Fixed a bug in the "Watchful Natives" code that caused the game to crash when fighting monsters (sigh).
# Melt-into-Mist and Pentangle now properly "nullify" spells/curses, and not cancel them!
# Fixed a bug where using a horse to move into a mountain clearing was not properly handling phases, and causing a minor crash
# Fixed a bug where activating Timeless Jewel immediately on discovery was causing a game freeze
# Fixed a gnarly bug in the combat interface, that occurs when you select an unassigned target while hidden, just prior to a spellcaster casting a spell (yes, very specific)
# Dragonfang necklace works on ALL dragons now, not just land dragons.  This includes the firedrake and venerable wyrm from Pruitt's alternative monster set.
# Fixed a crash related to the dragonfang necklace
# Changed a piece of code that may have been causing problems on Solaris 10 (the jury is out on this one)
# Can now click on the map during Prophecy or Timeless Jewel to move (just like during BIRDSONG)
# Pressing the MOVE button during Prophecy or Timeless Jewel, will now properly gray out other actions
# Can only burn color chits during the encounter step and daylight
# Charging characters works now:
	- Charger can not do any encounter actions
	- Chargee is subject to the penalties of having the MOVE chit on his/her sheet
	- Still to do:  make sure that charging character does not switch targets during the same round (2e: 34.4/1b)
# Fixed an issue where Druid going first would cancel the chit summoning for the entire evening!

Version 0.31 - June 10, 2006 - Changes since 0.30
NEW FEATURES:
# When trading with natives, you can now trade items as part of the cost
# 3rd-edition optional rules added:
	- Knight's Adjustment (ALLY becomes FRIENDLY)
	- Watchful Natives (mostly - natives assigned randomly to hirelings when character is hidden, for now)
# Couple of new features in the combat simulator:
	- You can adjust the HIDE status of hirelings separate from character
	- You can choose whether or not hireling horses are included
BUGS/ISSUES:
# Flowers of Rest owned by unhired native groups will cause people to sleep now (once they've been "seen")
# Resolved issues with Timeless Jewel:  RealmSpeak would get confused about your location if you tried moving through an undiscovered path.
# Fixed a problem with placing a horse during combat on the non-galloping side (trotting)
# Fixed an issue with the way rest phases were being counted during daylight
# Unfixed/Refixed the problem with the REST dialog - Now you can press the Done button if you still have REST phases, but it warns you that this is the case.  (otherwise, WITHER causes an unresolvable situation that causes the game to stop)
# Flying from combat will position you between two tiles - Flying MUST be your first action on the following day
# Activated horses and boots are properly handled when a new item is aquired that is too heavy for either to carry
# Artifacts and Books can now only be used once per evening
# Wish Strength can be used to open the VAULT
# Cloven Hoof in native inventory, having not been seen, no longer adds one to your die rolls
# Fixed an issue where hired leaders and controlled monsters couldn't open the VAULT, even though their strength was sufficient
# Fixed an inconsistency in the behavior of the buttons in the "Encounter" phase of combat.  Now ALL encounter actions require pressing NEXT, which means you also have a chance to press reset if you make an error.  This might take some getting used to...
# Dragonfang necklace works again
# Vial of Healing is implemented (I thought it was before, but I clearly never wrote code for it)
# Getting transported by the ToadstoolCircle no longer includes your hirelings (they are left behind)
# Familiar, Phantasm, Hired Leaders, and Controlled Monsters no longer count towards the "Character Limit" you set at the beginning of the game.
# Combat simulator works for setting up natives against natives without a character

# If you click on a clearing during the recording phase, RealmSpeak will now automatically record a MOVE action for the active character (no need to continuously hit the MOVE button)
BUGS/ISSUES:
# Reduced the delay in the server wait time per request.  This should make the online game a bit more spunky.  (Though I'm concerned it will have an adverse effect on slower computers... I'm sure you'll tell me if you have problems!)
# I think I fixed the recent combat frame problems for good.  I did a bit more hard-core testing, including all of these situations:
	- Normal combat for a single local player
	- Normal combat for a single online player
	- Normal combat for two local characters
	- Normal combat for two different online combats
	- Running from combat without hirelings
	- Running from combat with hirelings
	- Running from combat with another online character staying behind
	- Ending combat while in a clearing with another character's hireling(s)

# Fixed a bug that caused Native HQ's horse to get put into the native's hold when becoming unhired
# RealmSpeak no longer tries to make the Witch's familiar place a visitor/mission chit
# Discovering the Flowers of Sleep now affects players that have already taken their turn too
# Losing your turn do to the Flowers of Sleep will no longer summon monsters (as per Richard Hamblen's Q&A on Nand's site)
# Moved the "Setup Card" button out of the character frame, and into the character list window (makes more sense there)
# The REST dialog no longer allows you to skip your rests by pressing the Done button.
# The detail button in the combat frame now opens the game log window (or moves it to the front) since it now has the same information anyway
# When you do an SP phase and get the options, its much clearer which buttons will affect the tile, and which will affect the chit (the tile icon is included on the button)
# Fixed a bug where clearing restrictions (ie., Mountain clearing) were being ignored for spells on artifacts and books
# Fixed a bug where trying to use the extra ToadstoolCircle phase was failing.

Version 0.29.2 - April 10, 2006 - Changes since 0.29.1
BUGS/ISSUES:
# Fixed a problem with targeting monsters on another character's sheet while you have monsters on your own sheet (broke this back in version 0.24!)
# Fixed the run problem a different way (the way I fixed it in 0.29.1 didn't account for hirelings!  oops...)
# Fixed the situation where one hidden character is being battled by natives, and another unhidden character is not, and you couldn't press the End button.  (does that make any sense?)  In any case, it's fixed.
# Fatigue/Wounds center on combat frame now, NOT game frame

Version 0.29.1 - April 8, 2006 - Changes since 0.29
BUGS/ISSUES:

Version 0.29 - April 8, 2006 - Changes since 0.28
NEW FEATURES:
# No longer need to "approve" trades between characters belonging to the same player
# Improvements to the combat interface:
	- Pressing END now polls by PLAYER, not by CHARACTER.  This means that if you are playing a SOLO game, you need only press the END button one time per clearing.  No more endless clicks on the stupid END button when playing multiple characters in a solo game!!
	- All players can observe all battles now (no more twiddling your thumbs wondering what is going on)
	- Combat Window stays "open" until combat has ended for all players (no more flashing window - there is still some blink in the interface itself though)
	- "End Simulation" button when playing a combat simulation so you can quit right away.
# RealmBattle allows you to choose awakened spells on books now too
# New Help menu item: Key to Remodeled Counters
# Playing the game with combat turned OFF now displays the words "COMBAT OFF" instead of the "Daily Combat" checkbox.
BUGS/ISSUES:
# Fixed a bug when absorbing one of Pruitt's monsters
# "Hide character chits" option includes phantasms and familiars now

NEW FEATURES:
# RealmBattle (the battle simulator) now uses the chit style you have selected in RealmSpeak
# RealmBattle now supports making duplicates (if you so desire) of denizens for testing double-board battles.  Simply make sure the "Make Duplicates" checkbox is checked before adding denizens or hirelings.
# RealmBattle now allows you to choose an awakened spell for an artifact (not books yet)
BUGS/ISSUES:
# Fixed a bug with phases gained from permanent spells
# Fixed a general bug in the action panel behavior when the Timeless Jewel is activated

# Fixed a problem where characters are able to move Gloves cards from other characters
# When an invalid action is encountered during your turn, you must resolve the issue, or press Play Next to make it a BLANK phase.
# Multiple non-simultaneous hits on a mounted native will spill through to the rider, making it possible now to kill a mounted native in one round.
# If a character is not in the same clearing with his hirelings (they are following another character), the 1st hireling is highlighted on the character's turn in combat instead. (used to default to the first row which is confusing)
# Monsters under the influence of Melt-into-Mist no longer block character activities
# Misty monsters are ignored when determining whether the END button should be disabled or not (ie., you can end combat in a clearing that contains only a monster transformed into Mist)
# Another fix to Pruitt's monsters (sigh) to get them to return to the setup card properly
# Terror result in Power of the Pit, no longer kills L and M characters outright
# Power of the Pit no longer affects transformed character chits

# Dwarf (without the house rule) no longer does sun actions
# Mists (Melt into Mist) can only Move, Hide, or Follow, as per the rules

# Combat detail now correctly identifies when a horse is hit and/or killed
# Fixed a bug that caused strange behavior when getting opportunity or trouble rolls on the meeting tables

	- Placement by characters, or randomized

	- Campaign chits:  properly display partners/foes and who is left

NEW FEATURES:
# Error Logging - If RealmSpeak "freezes" or "crashes", look for a file in your RealmSpeak directory called "RealmSpeakErrorxxxx.log.  Send this to me, along with an explanation of what you were doing when it crashed (if you remember), and this should make fixing these types of bugs trivial.
# Treasure Setup Card view (see "Setup Card" button on Character Frame)
# Map is not revealed until host presses "Start Game" button - characters joining after the game is started MUST start at the Inn.
# No longer need to hold the CTRL key down to make multiple selections in the trade window.
# Moved trade/share button out of tabbed panes for easier access.  Sharing discoveries is included in the trade window now, so you can GET discoveries, as well as GIVE them.

	- Includes all missle/fumble die rolls, and the corresponding result

# Sunday Color Magic is now applied towards energizing permanent spells (watch out for Day 28, Sorceror!)
# Switched the default of the checkbox in the spell selector to hide unfinished spells from OFF to ON (every spell type has spells now, so there is no real reason to pick spells from unfinished ones anyway!)

# Remodeled BirdSong

	- Can no longer rearrange items, or do any trading (though there is a house rule to cancel this new behavior)
	- Items used to gain phases during Birdsong will be reactivated during Daylight when necessary and possible
	- Known available actions are shown while you are recording your turn
# Holding the SHIFT-key down while moving the mouse on the map, will show the "flipside" of the tile the pointer is on (my favorite new feature!)
# Holding the SHIFT-key down while moving the mouse on the combat sheet, allows you to view "flipside" of all counters in play (not quite as seamless as the map is, but it works)
# Two new warnings (see option menu) to help the player "remember" to assign hirelings during birdsong, and not record a HIRE-MOVE combination
# Separated the Druid Optional advantage into two separate options:  one for curse immunity, the other for Site summoning.  (I did this because I like the curse immunity, but not the lack of Site summoning!)

BUGS/ISSUES:
# Added a house rule option to allow rearranging belongings during birdsong (since this is now illegal with the "standard" rules)

# Fixed Pony movement - used to ignore extra MOVE phases when counting the double movement
# Fixed horse/pony handling when travelling through caves.
# "Discover Chits" results includes a peek at the chits in the tile (if necessary).
# Only true characters can be cursed (not hired leaders or controlled monsters)
# Only true characters can Read Runes
# Flying Carpet is more realistic now:  functions like a permanent spell has been cast on it (ie., walking through PURPLE magic will energize the carpet for combat)
# Wish for HEALTH no longer rests the chit used to cast it
# Fixed gold price for Regent of Jewels: was 8 gold!  Now its 67 gold.

# Fixed table selection problem when the list included DEAD characters
# Hirelings following a Hired Leader or Controlled Monster no longer vanish when their guide is killed
# Fixed the behavior of three potions: Oil of Poison, Ointment of Bite, Penetrating Grease.  These potions now properly stay with the weapon they are used on.  One other potion (Gripping Dust) already worked this way.
# New Options:
	- Replaced my Dwarf House Rule with Daniel Farrow's version from the Wiki
	- Added the revised "Hamblen Kludge Adjustment" for use with the revised missile table

Version 0.20.1 - November 26,2005 - Changes since 0.20:

# Can no longer "Hang Out" between clearings.  You MUST move to a clearing on your turn.
# Fixed issue where killing a monster with a transformed monster head/club was not scoring any fame or notoriety.

# Java 1.5 bug that prevented spell selection is fixed - those of you that had trouble with this should be able to choose a spellcaster now.
# Fixed logic to disallow actions in caves after using sunlight phases
# Horses inactivate in caves (the move logic was already there so you couldn't take advantage of a horse in a cave, but now the act of inactivating the horse is there too)
# More logic built into the inventory interface to prevent multiple weapons or similar armor types from being activated at once.
# Updated the chit discovery logic a bit, to better handle chits that are face down
# Fixed the handling of discovering a Site Card versus a Site Chit
# Now supports spying on Hidden Enemies to discover paths/passages and treasure locations.
# Treasure locations in the discovery panel show how many treasures are left.
# Added a flag to all treasures that are not yet supported, so its obvious why a particular activated item might not be working. As I add code to support each treasure's behavior, I'll remove this flag. Note that if "UNFINISHED" appears on a treasure, it only means that its full behavior isn't in place. You might find that some aspects of the treasure works as expected. ALL treasures "work" as far as Notoriety, Fame, Gold, and Weight are concerned.
# Marked all spells as "UNFINISHED" for now
# All Chit Altering treasures are now supported, which includes the Belt of Strength, Draught of Speed, Garb of Speed
# Fixed behavior of "Open" script to include Gloves, Boots and Horses when determining whether T strength is available
# Updated the Trading interface: base prices are shown for all items; both sides of horses and weapons are available; can sell more than one item at a time.

Version 0.1 - March 27, 2005 - Initial Release
# Most of the game mechanics are in place. You will be able to record actions, and carry them out as per the rules.
# Networking is fully supported. One person hosts the game, and any number (up to the maximum of 16 total) can join. Everyone sees the same map and pieces. There is even support for lost connections.
# There is NO CHAT interface. I felt that with software like TeamSpeak, or MSN Messenger, there was no read need to add a CHAT system directly to RealmSpeak. I do hope to add something in the near future, but it ranks pretty low on my list.
# Except for the Swordsman and Witch, all character advantages (and disadvantages) as described by the original game rules are in place.
# No optional or advanced rules are in place. You may see a few of these in the setup dialog, but these are merely placeholders for future options. Selecting them have no effect.
# The following actions are fully working: MOVE, HIDE, SEARCH, ALERT, SPELL, TRADE, and REST. The others (FOLLOW, HIRE, FLY, ENH-PEER, REMOTESPELL, CACHE) are disabled for now.
# Victory points are recorded at the beginning of the game for each character, and used to determine score at the end of the game (# of months to play is an option in the initial setup dialog).
# NO SPELL CASTING - You can select spells, learn and awaken spells, but you cannot cast them at this time.
# Most of the "non-combat" treasures work properly when activated. This means you can wear gloves/boots, drink potions, and ride horses.
# Monsters and Natives are summoned according to the rules.
# NO COMBAT - Please note that there is no combat at this point in the application. You will be able to do just about everything else, but encounters with monsters serve only to BLOCK your character. Yes, combat will be coming, but I wanted to get this piece out before I started working on that.
